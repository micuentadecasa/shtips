when trying to use reporting services configuration manager it doesn't works, it is because when installing the reporting
services in sharepoint integrated mode it doesn't install the report server neither the web for configuring the report server
so all the information about configuring it is incorrect because they talk about report server in alone mode not sharepoint mode

so even there exists the url http://xxxx/_vti_bin/reportserver all the configuration is done via the central administration, 
for example the rights are now permissions of sharepoint
