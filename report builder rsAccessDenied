when trying to create a new connection with report builder and entering credentials I got rsAccessDenied or when trying to access

http://spraso/_vti_bin/ReportServer and entering to any directory I got a rsAccessDenied

the problem is that the user I was trying to use has no user mappings on the databases of reporting, so:

In credentials use spadmin (use this user name and password option), check "use as window credentials" 
In General use Microsoft sharepoint list as type of connection and http://spraso as connection string

when using a user check their permissions in Sql server reporting services databases.
