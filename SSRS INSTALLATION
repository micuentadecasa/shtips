en este se explica como crear las librerías

otro fallo, una vez configurada una librería intento editar un .rdl report que he subido a mano y me dice que SSRS no está configurado
el problema es que para la zona custom no está configurado, ir a Central administration/manage web application/seleccionar nuestra app
y darle a service connections  - cambiar a zona custom y habilitar ssrs y secure storage

otro fallo :

ermissions granted to user ‘NT AUTHORITY\ANONYMOUS LOGON’ are insufficient for performing this operation. —> Microsoft.ReportingServices.Diagnostics.Utilities.AccessDeniedException: The permissions granted to user ‘NT AUTHORITY\ANONYMOUS LOGON’ are insufficient for performing this operation.​

when I googled this error it gets me lots of soultions from the internet however none of them couldn’t fix my problem or the soultion was not fitting exacly to my problem in my opinion.

I went to Central Administration of my SharePoint and try workaround with it and this was the key to fix my problem.

Open your “Manage Web Applications” in “CA” and then click on your Web App where problem exist, then choose the “Authentication Providers”
 

and choose the “Zone” which you “Web App” is using
 
uncheck the box of the “anonumous access” setting and you done !
 
------------------------

PerformancePoint services uses Secure store service 

if Secure store service is not running then go to central-> manage services on server-> start , then go to Central->manage service applications
and if not exits create a new Secure Store service application, then follow this
